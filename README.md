# NutrientView

NutrientView is a mobile app developed by Syed Rizvi that allows for convenient nutrient tracking and viewing.

The aim of the app is to provide users with an easy viewing experience of what nutrients they are getting enough
of through their diets, and what they are deficient in. The app has a food image recognition system to allow
for easy logging of food, along with manual input if the user needs to enter specialized food that is not in the
system.

This mobile app is not for dieting or exercise regimens, as there are plenty of existing apps that fulfill that
function already. This app is instead focused on giving users a clean and easily-viewable micronutrient profile,
to show them what nutrient deficiencies their current diets put them in.

Features of the app include:
- Image recognition and manual entry options for logging meals
- Daily nutrient progress view
- Calendar that can pull up nutrient deficiency data from past days
- A Q&A bot service that can give users basic information about important nutrients

Services used by this project:
- IBM Watson food image recognition
- Edamam Nutrition Analysis API service
- Microsoft Azure Bot Service, QnA maker, and Cognitive Services
- Firebase Realtime Database, Storage, and Hosting
