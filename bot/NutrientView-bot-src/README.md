NutrientView Q&A Azure Bot Service

This QnA bot was created by Syed Rizvi for the NutrientView project, giving users
basic information about important nutrients when prompted. 

Created using Azure bot service and QnA maker service

Due to complications with integrating the chatbot with an Expo mobile application,
this bot is hosted on a website with Firebase Hosting, and is incorporated into the
mobile app using a WebView component. If a better solution for incorporating an
Azure bot into an Expo app is functional, then the app integration will be updated.
